            <h2 id="Myth-“Objects-are-passed-by-reference-primitives-are-passed-by-value”"><a href="#Myth-“Objects-are-passed-by-reference-primitives-are-passed-by-value”" class="headerlink" title="Myth: “Objects are passed by reference, primitives are passed by value”"></a>Myth: “Objects are passed by reference, primitives are passed by value”</h2><p>Some proponents of this then say, “Ah, except for immutable objects which are passed by value [etc]” which introduces loads of rules without really tackling how Java works. Fortunately the truth is much simpler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth #1: Everything in Java is passed by value. Objects, however, are never passed at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That needs some explanation - after all, if we can’t pass objects, how can we do any work? The answer is that we pass references to objects. That sounds like it’s getting dangerously close to the myth, until you look at truth #2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth #2: The values of variables are always primitives or references, never objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably the single most important point in learning Java properly.<br>It’s amazing how far you can actually get without knowing it, in fact - but vast numbers of things suddenly make sense when you grasp it.</p>
<h2 id="Why-is-all-this-important"><a href="#Why-is-all-this-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is all this important?"></a>Why is all this important?</h2><p>When people hear the words “pass by reference”, they may understand different things by the words. There are some pretty specific definitions of what it should mean, however. Dale King sometimes quotes this one: “The lvalue of the formal parameter is set to the lvalue of the actual parameter.” (Dale’s formal analysis of this whole question can be found at the bottom of this page.) This would mean that if you wrote the following code:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Object x = null;</div><div class="line">giveMeAString(x);</div><div class="line">System.out.println(x);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">void giveMeAString(Object y) &#123;</div><div class="line">  y = &quot;This is a string&quot;;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>the result (if Java used pass-by-reference semantics) would be</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">This is a string</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>instead of the actual result:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">null</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Explaining the two truths above eliminates all of this confusion.</p>
<p>So what does passing a reference by value actually mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means you can think of references how you think of primitives, to a large extent. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, the equivalent to the above bit of code using primitives would be:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">int x = 0;</div><div class="line">giveMeATen(x);</div><div class="line">System.out.println(x);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">void giveMeATen (int y) &#123;</div><div class="line">  y = 10;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<h1 id="The-balloon-analogy"><a href="#The-balloon-analogy" class="headerlink" title="The balloon analogy"></a>The balloon analogy</h1><p>I imagine every object as a helium balloon, every reference as a piece of string, and every variable as something which can hold onto a piece of string. </p>
<p>If the reference is a null reference, that’s like having a piece of string without anything attached to the end. If it’s a reference to a genuine object, it’s a piece of string tied onto the balloon representing that object. When a reference is copied (either for variable assignment or as part of a method call) it’s as if another piece of string is created attached to whatever the first piece of string is attached to. The actual piece of string the variable (if any) is holding onto doesn’t go anywhere - it’s only copied.</p>
<p>This analogy also explains garbage collection (apart from the java.lang.ref API, which does “odd” things :) - a balloon floats away unless it is tethered down to something. The balloons can have further holders on them (instance variables), but just because two balloons are holding onto each other doesn’t stop them from floating away. (Cyclic references are collected.) Any balloon representing an object which is in the middle of having a method invoked is tethered to the JVM. (Apologies for not being able to phrase that more succinctly - all I mean is that anything in an active thread’s stack isn’t garbage collected.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2012/12/is-it-time-for-you-to-stop-dabbling-and-get-serious/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2012/12/is-it-time-for-you-to-stop-dabbling-and-get-serious/</a></p>
<p> If you want to start on a serious career path, don’t even think about giving up during the first year. Very little happens during the first year in terms of results. Most businesses aren’t even profitable in their first 2 years; it takes them that long just to become sustainable, even for fairly small businesses.</p>
<p> So many would-be pro bloggers give up in their first 6 months. They get bored, lose interest, or get a “better” idea for some other venture. I see them change topics or URLs and start over once or twice a year. After five years of this kind of dabbling, they’ve still barely gotten anywhere. They keep erasing what little progress they’ve made, so they never have the chance to develop anything serious and enduring.</p>
<p> When it comes to building any sort of business, either online or offline, this dabbling approach is a bit ridiculous because the real payoff from business comes from consistency over a period of years. It takes time to build a following, attract customers, develop products and services, gain links and search engine placement, generate referrals, develop good business sense, acquire expertise, and figure out how to generate income from your work in ways that feel congruent to you.</p>
<p> It took 25 months from when I started blogging to pass $10K/month in income from it, which happened in 2006. In the first 6 months, however, my blog only made $167 total, mostly from Amazon’s affiliate program. If I gave up during that time and started over, I’d never have enjoyed the long-term benefits of this path. Most professional bloggers, however, give up well before they reach this point. They see weak financial results during their first year just as I did, but they conclude it’s not worth continuing if they haven’t made it sustainable by then.</p>
<p> In addition to earning abundant income from blogging (mostly from affiliate and joint-venture deals these days), blogging has also created opportunities in other areas, like speaking (I have talks coming up in Las Vegas, Rio, Germany, and Washington DC), getting a book published (ongoing royalties), coaching (started at $997 per coaching call, now at $4997 per call), free travel, amazing social connections, etc.</p>
<p> If you want to generate serious income and enjoy an abundant lifestyle, it’s crucial to get past the dabbling phase. For starters the incessant dabblers are perpetually broke. They keep giving up and changing their minds well before they’d otherwise begin reaping the long-term benefits of sustainability and growth. Before they even have a chance to experience serious results, they pull the plug.</p>
<p> The truth is that you can generate serious income from just about any form of creative work — writing, audio, video, art, music, programming, design, etc. Others who came before you have already made millions from these paths. But most of them didn’t get very far in their first 6-12 months. It’s the ones who stuck with it for 5+ years that are reaping the biggest benefits. They’re builders, not dabblers.</p>
<p> A pattern I’ve noticed in my most successful friends in business is that at some point they made the decision to get serious about their work. They decided to stop dabbling, stop drifting, and stop coasting. They committed to a particular path and doubled down on it, intending to stick with it for years so they could really master it. Consequently, those same people are enjoying serious results. Meanwhile, the dabblers are still looking for that next Get Rich Quick idea that can grant similar results within a matter of months.</p>
<p> If you ask your friends what kind of work you’ll be doing 5 years from now, what will they say? If you’re not sure, go ask some of them. If they give you answers you don’t like, or if their answers are inconsistent, why is that? Are you broadcasting that you’re a dabbler? Do you have a history of dabbling? Are you being wishy washy and noncommittal? If you think you’re committed, but the people around you don’t perceive that commitment, you’re probably not committed.</p>
<p> If you’re on a strong and successful path, the people in your life will likely be able to predict what field you’ll be in 5 years from now. It will be the field you’re committed to right now.</p>
<p> If you want to build up some abundant income streams and enjoy the long-term benefits of stick-to-itiveness, pick an interest that you expect you’ll still be passionate about 5 years from now. I picked personal growth since I’d already been passionate about this field for more than a decade before I started blogging, so I had good cause to believe I’d still be into it 5 years later. It’s now 8+ years since I started blogging, and I’m still passionate about personal growth. I still love the work I do and have no desire to quit and switch to something else. The specific details of my interests change from year to year, but my core passion remains largely the same. If I’d made a less conscious choice or more impulsive choice 8 years ago, I might very well have dumped it within the first year.</p>
<p> Don’t overplay today’s fleeting interests when you think about making a serious commitment to a career path. Look instead to the interests you had 5 years ago that you’re still seriously interested in today. Chances are you’ll still be maintaining those interests 5 years from now. If you’re going to have these interests anyway, why not bet bigger on them and commit yourself to mastery?</p>
<p> Doing something for a long time isn’t the same thing as committing to mastery. I’ve been into disc golf for about as long as I’ve been into personal growth (20+ years), but I never committed to improving disc golf. I never got serious about it. Even though I play disc golf most weekends with friends, I’m probably no better at it than I was 5 years ago. My skills hit a plateau, and I’ve stayed there for years. For me disc golf is a hobby I enjoy for fun, and I haven’t cared to improve at it thus far.</p>
<p> If you’re okay being no better off in your career 5 years from now, then there’s no need to commit to mastery. Keep dabbling, or keep doing what you’re doing without making a serious commitment. But if it’s not very palatable to you to stagnate, or if you desire much stronger results 5 years from now, then it’s time to think about getting serious.</p>
<p> If you want to dabble for the sake of exploration, that’s fine. But don’t pretend you’ve chosen a career path. You’ll only look foolish when every 6 months you’re telling your friends that your career path has changed yet again. Know that you’re exploring, and do it to learn. Then when you’re ready to get serious, commit to building something that endures, and don’t even think about quitting during the first year.</p>
<p> Rule of thumb: If you can’t make a serious 5-year commitment to a given career path, it’s not your path.</p>

            <p>It’s late on a Friday afternoon. You’ve already spent hours on a mind-twisting task. But before you can turn in for the evening you have another demanding project that requires your attention.</p>
<p>It’s going to take some serious willpower to stay focused. Will you power through? Or will you stagger to the weekend? The answer depends on how you think about your state of mind in this kind of situation</p>
<p>Perhaps you think of willpower like fuel in a car – your reserves are already running low and the last project is going to drain you further. Or maybe you see willpower as sustained by a challenge - you’re feeling fatigued but you know engaging with the last project will recharge you.</p>
<p>Ongoing research by psychologists suggests that these two perspectives on willpower are self-fulfilling. Just thinking that willpower is a limited resource makes it more likely that you’ll feel depleted after a demanding task. However, if you see challenges as motivation, you are more likely to perform as if your willpower is unlimited.</p>
<p>Veronika Job at the University of Zurich and her colleagues at Stanford University tested this by asking 60 students whether willpower is a limited resource that’s depleted by effort, or if it’s potentially unlimited and recharged by a challenge. Next, the students were given two taxing mental tasks in succession. The first was an awkward editing task, the second involved naming the actual color of color words while ignoring their meaning (e.g. the word “green” written in red).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you see challenges as motivation, you are more likely to perform as if your willpower is unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For students who believed that willpower is a limited resource, giving them an extra tricky editing task left them frazzled for the color-naming challenge and their performance suffered as a result. It was a different story for the students who saw their willpower as unlimited. They performed just as well on the color-naming challenge regardless of whether the editing task was made extra difficult or not. In other words, whatever the students believed about willpower ended up coming true.</p>
<p>Of course, a problem with this study is that it’s possible the students who saw willpower as unlimited really did have a lot of willpower. Fortunately there’s evidence that suggests it’s easy to optimize our mindset, with potential benefits for our performance. For a study published this year, instead of measuring students’ beliefs about willpower, Job and her co-workers at Stanford instead tried seeing how easy it is to influence those beliefs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s evidence that suggests it’s easy to optimize our mindset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers found that having the students think about willpower as fueled by challenge – they exposed them to a series of statements like “it is energizing to be fully absorbed with a demanding mental task” – was enough to help boost their performance. When they undertook an arduous 20-minute memory challenge on a computer, rather than getting mentally fatigued, their performance kept getting better. Other students exposed to statements about willpower being limited only showed improvement through half the task, after which they zoned out. In other words, how we think about willpower seems highly suggestible, which then affects our performance.</p>
<p>Taken together, this research shows how important our attitudes about willpower are for the way we perform, and why it is vital to get in the right mindset before undertaking a piece of demanding work. The next time you’re confronted by a daunting task late in the day, remind yourself that mental perseverance is often a case of “mind over mind.” If you see it as a draining chore, it’s likely you really will act as though mentally exhausted. But if you see the work as a challenge that will engage your mind, you’ll find that you rise to the occasion..</p>

            <h1 id="Memory-is-key"><a href="#Memory-is-key" class="headerlink" title="Memory is key"></a>Memory is key</h1><p>According to a new study, how hungry you are may be less influenced by how much you ate earlier but rather by <em>how much you remember eating</em>. To keep yourself from eating too often and too much, consider the practice of mindful eating—paying more attention while eating.</p>
<p>In the study published in the PLOS ONE journal, University of Bristol gave 100 volunteers lunch with either a small or large portion of tomato soup as an appetizer. The bowls had a secret tube that refilled or drained the soup without the participants knowing, so half of them ended up eating more or less than what their eyes told them they were eating. Predictably, right after the meal, the participants’ hunger levels were tied to how much of the soup they actually ate. But two to three hours later, how much they thought they had eaten mattered more: Those who believed they had a larger portion (regardless of actually eating that much or not) said they felt less hungry for another meal than the group who thought they had the smaller portion. According to the researchers, memory can have a bigger influence on appetite than the actual meal size.</p>
<p>How to apply this to real life? Time suggests focusing on our food more and avoiding distractions while eating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take three seconds to look closely at what you are eating,” she says. “Think for a moment about the words that spring to mind: small, large, filling, etc.,” [clinical psychologist Susan Albers] says. “Taking a moment to consciously and thoughtfully encode this meal into your memory will make it more likely that you will remember what you’ve eaten later.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping your eyes on your food is also important to prevent eating too much in one sitting. The New York Times has a great article on mindful eating if you’re interested in putting this into practice yourself.</p>

<p>Between work, classes, and socializing, life can get pretty hectic. In response, we often rely on caffeinated drinks to keep us going. Sure, everyone knows that caffeine can give you a much-needed jolt, but at what cost? It can also cause headaches, breakouts, and mood swings, just to name a few negative side effects. The good news: there are better, healthier ways to get energy without all that caffeine clogging your system.</p>
<h1 id="Have-a-Protein-Filled-Snack"><a href="#Have-a-Protein-Filled-Snack" class="headerlink" title="Have a Protein-Filled Snack"></a>Have a Protein-Filled Snack</h1><p>Feeling drowsy? Nosh on a protein-packed snack. This is a simple but effective way to keep yourself going throughout the day. Think crunchy apple slices with creamy peanut butter, turkey roll-ups with string cheese, or almonds and dried fruit. If you’re crunched for time, pick up a smoothie with a protein boost—most places offer free “boosts.” Jamba Juice has a great energy one that has B vitamins in it to help physical and mental stamina. Bonus: it helps your metabolism too!</p>
<h1 id="Pop-a-B-Vitamin"><a href="#Pop-a-B-Vitamin" class="headerlink" title="Pop a B Vitamin"></a>Pop a B Vitamin</h1><p>Vitamin B deficiency has been linked to low energy levels, among other things. In fact, mood changes, poor concentration, anxiety, and depression can all be signs of a vitamin B deficiency. So if you’re feeling tired regularly, try popping a B-complex vitamin. Most grocers and health food stores carry a variety of brands that you can choose from. Another option is to take a multivitamin, which will help ensure that you’re not deficient in other minerals or nutrients. For the best results, take your multivitamin during a meal—preferably breakfast. According to NutriHealth, the nutrients are better absorbed when mixed with the healthy fat in your food.</p>
<h1 id="Try-a-Quick-Workout"><a href="#Try-a-Quick-Workout" class="headerlink" title="Try a Quick Workout"></a>Try a Quick Workout</h1><p>When you’re tired, hitting the gym is the last thing you want to do. But studies show that a short sweat session can kick up your energy levels for the rest of the day. According to Fitness Magazine, you don’t need to pound the treadmill for an hour—a quick jog around the block will do. Feeling unmotivated? Pop in some headphones, cue up your favorite upbeat tunes, and hit the pavement! If you want to stay in your room, a quick set of 25 jumping jacks can help give you a boost.</p>
<h1 id="Take-A-Cold-Shower"><a href="#Take-A-Cold-Shower" class="headerlink" title="Take A Cold Shower"></a>Take A Cold Shower</h1><p>Hot showers are the best for relaxing and winding down. But if your goal is to do the opposite, consider changing the temperature. Cold water stimulates your system and speeds up circulation, resulting in a more alert you. Don’t want to give up the soothing heat completely? Try taking a regular shower, then cooling it down for the last 5 minutes or so. It’ll still do wonders for your mental awareness. Really not into the cold shower thing? Splash cold water on your face for a midday refresher.</p>
<h1 id="Eat-Smaller-More-Frequent-Meals"><a href="#Eat-Smaller-More-Frequent-Meals" class="headerlink" title="Eat Smaller, More Frequent Meals"></a>Eat Smaller, More Frequent Meals</h1><p>According to Terri Fant-Franklin, a nutritionist at Kaiser Permanente, changing your eating habits can greatly increase your energy levels. “Having smaller, more frequent meals will keep your calorie flow at a more even pace which helps with energy,” Fant-Franklin says. Heavy meals often leave us feeling drowsy, while smaller portions can have the opposite effect. Try to avoid sugary drinks, which are often loaded with caffeine and additives. Chances are, you’ll end up crashing later.</p>
<h1 id="Go-To-Sleep-20-Minutes-Earlier"><a href="#Go-To-Sleep-20-Minutes-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="Go To Sleep 20 Minutes Earlier"></a>Go To Sleep 20 Minutes Earlier</h1><p>It’s easy to procrastinate during the day and put off projects until the wee hours of the night. But this pushes your bedtime back later and later. Before you know it, you wake up on four hours’ worth of sleep, tired and cranky. Let’s just say that this situation is less than ideal. But there’s a simple and effective way to change your habits. Instead of being unrealistic and wishing you could sleep through that 7AM alarm, take action the night before. Aim to hit the sack 20-30 minutes earlier and chances are, you’ll end up getting significantly more sleep.</p>
<h1 id="Take-a-Walk"><a href="#Take-a-Walk" class="headerlink" title="Take a Walk"></a>Take a Walk</h1><p>Taking a brisk stroll has similar effects to working out. According to WebMD, moving your body (even at a slow pace) will have you feeling more alert in just minutes. Since the weather has cooled down, the chilly winter air will also help wake up your senses. Worried you’ll get bored? Grab your camera and snap photos of the beautiful fall foliage you see along the way. You can also incorporate this tip into your daily routine by walking instead of taking the bus or driving. Bonus: a leisurely walk is great for clearing up brain fog, which can result from hours spent at a desk or too much computer time. So next time you need a break from doing work or studying, head outside.</p>
<h1 id="Get-A-Reflexology-Massage"><a href="#Get-A-Reflexology-Massage" class="headerlink" title="Get A (Reflexology) Massage"></a>Get A (Reflexology) Massage</h1><p>In the practice of reflexology, your hands and feet are filled with pressure points that relate to specific areas of the body. For example, the top part of your thumbs correlates with your pituitary gland. Massages generally leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, but reflexology takes things one step further and pinpoints specific areas that need work. According to The American Reflexology Certification Board, the practice helps restore balance to the body. Try making an appointment with a specialist or give yourself a quick massage (or recruit a friend to) for a DIY midday pick-me-up. Apply pressure to the different areas on your hands and feet, alternating to stimulate multiple organs. It’ll double as a mental break, preparing you for the rest of your busy day!</p>
<h1 id="Talk-It-Out"><a href="#Talk-It-Out" class="headerlink" title="Talk It Out"></a>Talk It Out</h1><p>Next time you’re feeling down and tired, try talking to a friend. Studies show that chatting can help make you feel more alert. Being socially disconnected can trickle into other areas of your life, resulting in negative thoughts and lower levels of productivity. Catching up on gossip will pique your interest and keep you going. Friends too busy to talk? Calling someone works too. Dial your mom’s cell and catch up on the latest family news.</p>
<h1 id="Meditate"><a href="#Meditate" class="headerlink" title="Meditate"></a>Meditate</h1><p>The mind is a powerful tool. It’s been proven that visualization exercises can help bring you closer to achieving your goals. A recent Miller-McCune article discusses the many benefits of meditation. Next time you’re feeling zapped for energy, try this simple exercise: sit on a chair with your back straight and your hands on your knees. Close your eyes and envision yourself feeling positive and energized. Take deep breaths and keep your posture strong. Before long, you’ll have an increased sense of mental and physical awareness.</p>
